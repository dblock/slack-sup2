  long_description: The most valuable relationships are not made of two people, they're made of three. A third person will always stabilize and grow the relationship between the other two. It's called a triad, and the more you create, the stronger your network. This bot passively generates fresh triads of channel members to meet every week in an informal standup, or S'Up.
